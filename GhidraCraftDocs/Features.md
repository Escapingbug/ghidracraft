# Custom Features

- A new dark-theme is introduced and set as default theme. Currently, this might introduce some color
problems. But we will gradually fix those.
- Some of the colors are now possible to be customized in Color.properties (see [color customization doc](./ghidracraft/color_customize.md))
- New feature: pcode patch. see [pcode patch doc](./ghidracraft/pcode_patch.md)
- Add IDA style (well, partially) variable default naming to the decompiler. (can be enabled by Edit -> Tool Options -> Decompiler -> Analysis -> Short variable names)
- OLLVM cross-architecture deobfuscation script. see [ollvm deobfuscation doc](./ghidracraft/ollvm_deob.md)
